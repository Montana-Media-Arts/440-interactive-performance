# Project 2 | Tracking & Following

- _Launch: Wednesday, February 21st_
- _Sketch due: Wednesday, February 28th_
- **Project due:** Wednesday, March 14th
    - 3 week timeline
- **Documentation due:** Monday, March 19th


# Description

For **project 2**, you are to create/compose/write/develop a piece that explores _Tracking & Following_.

## Tracking

You should explore the idea of _tracking_ in an _interactive performance system_.

To do this, you may ask questions such as;

- How can an agent in an _interactive performance system_ track some element of a performance?
- What elements can a computer agent track?
    - vision
        - blobs
        - colors
        - faces
        - bodies
        - motion
    - sound
        - amplitude
        - frequency
        - location
    - motion
        - accelerometers
        - gyroscopes
        - GPS
    - data
        - social media data
        - home statistics
- How can a human performer agent track a computer?
    - motion
        - can the computer agents move?
    - can the human agent track projections?
    - can the human agent track sound?

## Following

You are also to explore how an agent can _follow_ another agent in ann _interactive performance system_.

This may lead to questions such as;

- Am I implementing "Simon Says"?
- How can agents of different types track elements of each other?
    - Do they have to track in the same domain?

More importantly, you should ask what _following_ means to the agent being _followed_?

# Specs

As allows, your creative artwork/piece should adhere to certain specifications.

1. Minimum number of agents; >=2
2. The piece should take place in time, as a performance for an audience.
3. At least one of the agents should be a computer agent.
    - Please note: there is not a minimum number of human agents required for this project.
4. Your piece should take between 1-5 minutes to perform.
5. Your piece should be easily setup for a performance.
6. You may work alone or in groups of 2 (no more).






# For the Sketch Review

**Questions you MUST answer;**

- How might a performance of this work unfold?
- Why should this work be performed?
    - A performance of your work should be necessary to its realization and appreciation. In other words, I am asking you to conceptualize a work that is bested suited for live performance, and not best suited for some other delivery method
- Please identify and describe the interfaces for interaction between agents.
    - How many interfaces are there?
    - What domain are the interfaces in? (i.e. sound, vision, physical world, internal of the computer)
- How many, and what are, the agents of your system?
- How would you classify/genre-ize your work?

**Things to have prepared;**

- A sketch of what this performance space might look like.
- A short mock-up or demo of the type of material the work might create as a result. (Visual, sound, text output, etc.)
- A short (1-2 paragraph) description of your work.
- A list (with links when available) to influences for your work, and artists/pieces that are similar to your ideas.
- The ability to verbally answer any of the questions above, clearly, succinctly, and articulately.

The hard deliverable listed above will be presented via computer, speakers, and projector to the class.


# Performance Information

- The performance will occur during normal class time, in Lab 127 of McGill.
- You may not miss the performance (unless you are unexpectedly sick and have a doctors note).
- There will be no extensions given for the performance presentation.
- You are expected to support and view your fellow colleagues work.


# Documentation Information

As always, you are expected to complete and submit documentation about this work, your performance, and the process. This documentation work will be due by the class period following the performance.

For this project, you documentation should include;

1. A 6 page, conference format paper.
    - This provide an overview about the work,
    - as well as describe;
        - related work that is similar and/or inspired this work (literature review),
        - the process of developing and building the work, (process)
        - the presentation/performance of the work, (process)
        - the technical achievements of the work (results)
        - the success or failure of the performance (results)
    - and conclude with a discussion of what you would do going forward, if you were to continue with this project.
2. A video of a performance of the work
3. A separate video describing the work
    - this will likely include a voice-over
    - shots of the development process
    - a description of what occurred.
4. A score/script representing performance instructions.
    - this may include code
    - software
    - visual guides
    - text/prose guides9
