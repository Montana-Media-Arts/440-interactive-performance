## Description

_Interactive Media 2; Performance_ explores the theory and technique of interactive art through the lens of performance systems.

What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hands-on course, students will learn how to create interactive systems for performance. We will talk about what it means to create an interactive experience for you to use in performance. This will be examined in terms of usability, transparency, agency, and flexibility.
