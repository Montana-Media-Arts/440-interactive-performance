# Final Project Specifications

_April 24th, 2020_

The following are the expected specifications and deliverables for the MART 440 final project, for the Spring 2020 semester (COVID-19 distance learning finish).

## Overview

For your final project, you are expected to create an artistic work, that leverages interactive art theory, interactive system theory, interactive practices, and/or interactive technologies.

If possible, this should be a performative work (i.e. something you create in real-time in collaboration with or through the utilization of an interactive system). However, given the unprecedented compromises to the semester as a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, students are instead asked to create any artwork (performative, fixed, or gallery style) that explores their interests and relationship to interactive art (as specified by any of the above approaches). _(Since this document is being written after the iteration 1 critique, you are guaranteed to be creating a project that is acceptable to these specifications. Just keep creating!)_

## Deliverables

1. The most important and significant deliverable is a video, which is representative of the art work. I.E. This video is the work of art that you are essentially submitting. The submitted video should stand on its own, require no further description, and be an artistic experience. 
	- This is not a demo, behind-the-scenes, or explanation style video.
	- Instead, this should be a video that is an artwork. Much like a music video or video of a live performance. The goal of this video is for viewers to experience your work of art, as if they were experiencing it live in an auditorium, theater, gallery, woods, etc. 
	- Your video should include title, creator credits, and a date.
	- Likewise, if you are using material from other creators, you should properly credit that work at the end of your video. 
	- Please upload these videos to youtube, vimeo, or similar. 
	- You will submit a link to the video as hosted on one of these sites. 
2. You are also to submit a secondary video or paper. This deliverable is where you can describe the work of art, the process of creating it, and give us the "behind-the-scenes" type of information about the artwork. 
	- You are welcome to create a demo/documentation video OR write a short paper describing the work of art and creative process. 
	- If this is a video, please upload to a video site, such as youtube, vimeo, etc. You will then include the link as part of your submission. 
	- If this is a paper, please SAVE AS, a PDF. Submit the PDF as a document along with your main submission.
