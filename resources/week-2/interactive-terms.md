# Discussion and Terms of Interactive Art Systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# **Basic Definitions**

# Interactive

- Related
    - Interactivity
    - Interaction

A system, with at least 2 agents, who have an equal opportunity of affecting state changes in every other agent.

# Reactive

A one-way sharing of information, with the goal of changing something else.

# Dynamic

A system marked by usually continuous and productive activity or change.

# Dynamical

<!-- Skipping. But relates, just not sure how to present this concept yet... -->

# System

Some sort of organized group of things, that do something.

# Liveness

The perception of whether something is actually occurring in real-time? (i.e., the e-mail problem)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
# **Types of Systems**

What are the four types of systems as described in the Frengel?

# Interactive System Models

1. The instrumental model
    - reactive system
    - something that a performer understands its possible outputs
2. The conductor model
    - moderator of output information
    - typically includes fixed-media
    - controls timing, etc
    - not at the micro-level of the instrument
3. The reflexive model
    - starting to introduce true agency
    - responds to something at the input
    - may make its own choices
    - However, still expected results
4. The virtual performer model
    - working towards full agency

# Emprical Classifications (drummond)

1. performer with system;
2. audience with system; and
3. performer with system with audience.

# Classification dimensions (drummond)

1. score-driven vs. performance-driven systems;
2. transformative, generative or sequenced response methods; and
3. Instrument vs. player paradigms.

# **System Design Terms**

# Affordance

# Constraints

# Agency

# Agent


# Mapping

What are the four types of mappings?


# Control

# Feedback


-------------------------------------------------------------------
# **System Parts**

Three basic parts of a system?


-------------------------------------------------------------------
# **Audience/Spectator**

# perception of agency

# perception of interaction

• How does the spectator know that the performer is communicating with the system?
• How does the spectator know that the system is responding to the performer?
• How does the spectator think the user controls the system?
• How does the spectator know that the system is doing the right thing?
• How does the spectator know when the performer or the system has made a mistake?
