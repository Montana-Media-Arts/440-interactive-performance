# Project 1 | Liveness in interactive art + performance


- Sketch due: Monday, January 28th
- **Project due:** Wednesday, February 6th
- **Documentation due:** Wednesday, February 13th

Write, develop, compose, and/or create an "interactive art + performance" piece capable of _live_ presentation. This work could be a;

- theatre work
- music composition
- visual composition


# Ideas to Explore

## Liveness

- What is liveness?
- How does your work explore the issue of liveness?
- How if your work live?

The primary exploration topic of this project is around the idea of "liveness". I want you to grapple with the idea of liveness, what it is, and how it is at play in your work.

This means that your work likely needs to be somewhat unique with each performance. How is this accomplished? If at all?

Is it sufficient to simply call a live performance "live"? How is your work different than an electronic musician who simply "presses the start button".


## Performance

How are you going to include the necessary element of performance to your work?

- Are you going to perform?
- Are you going to make someone else perform?
- Is the computer going to perform?
    - Alone?
    - As a separate agent?
    - As an augmentation of someone else?

## Time

Since this is a performance based piece, _time_ must be considered. How does time factor in to your work?


## Interactivity

What is interactive in your work? How does it fit into one of the models explored in class from either the Drummond or Saltz articles?


## Interactive System Model

What model of interactive art system are you going to employ?

### Interactive System Models (Frengel)

1. The instrumental model
2. The conductor model
3. The reflexive model
4. The virtual performer model

### Emprical Classifications (drummond)

1. performer with system;
2. audience with system; and
3. performer with system with audience.

### Classification dimensions (drummond)

1. score-driven vs. performance-driven systems;
2. transformative, generative or sequenced response methods; and
3. Instrument vs. player paradigms.



## Technology

What technology are you going to utilize to achieve your desired work? How does it assist with the issues and topics mentioned above? How does it complicate them?

For example, if you are using pre-rendered media, how does that effect issues of liveness or performance?

If you are using physical computing components or controllers, how do these effect the development cycle?

Are you giving any sense of agency to your piece or the technology in it? Why or why not?


# Specs

The following are specifications for the completion of your project.

1. The work should be capable of being presented live, as a performance, in class on the critique/presentation day.
2. The work should be between 1 minute and 6 minutes in length.
3. You can work alone, or in groups of two.
    - If your work requires additional people for presentation, you are welcome to ask your classmates to participate. However, you (and potentially your partner) are responsible for the work.
4. If this work has a score, script, or other document specifying actions over time, you should bring copies of that to the performance.
5. You should find at least 5 influences for this work. Document these, they are required in your final written report.
